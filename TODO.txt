Current goal: Simulate a single particle moving in a vector force field over time due to some kind of force.
1. Choose a development environment
2. High level pseudo code
3. Generate a vector field from a force field input
4. Simulate a particle moving due to the field
5. Simulate a particle moving due to the field and another force(s)



Overall Steps:
Simulate a single particle moving in a vector force field over time due to force(s)
Correctly generate a vector force field given a user input
Build a selection of cells 



All forces acting on a particle:
DEP force
gravity
bouyancy
drag
Brownian
collisions with other simulated particles



User options/inputs:
Force field
Cells
Start/pause/reset simulation
